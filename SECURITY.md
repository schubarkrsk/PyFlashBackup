# PyFlashBackup Security Policy

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

At PyFlashBackup, we take the security of our users and their data seriously. If you discover any security vulnerabilities or issues within PyFlashBackup, we encourage you to responsibly disclose them to our team.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Privately Notify Us:**
   Please send an email to [stas-chubar@yandex.ru](mailto:stas-chubar@yandex.ru) with a detailed description of the vulnerability. We request that you do not disclose the details publicly until we have had an opportunity to review and address the issue.

2. **Provide Information:**
   Include relevant information in your report, such as:
   - A brief description of the vulnerability.
   - Steps to reproduce the vulnerability.
   - The version of PyFlashBackup where the vulnerability is present.

3. **Encrypt Your Communication:**
   If possible, use our PGP key to encrypt your communication. You can find our [PGP public key here](https://github.com/schubarkrsk/pgp-keys/blob/main/public.txt).

4. **Response and Collaboration:**
   Our security team will acknowledge your report promptly. We will work with you to understand and validate the issue. Once the issue is confirmed, we will collaborate on a resolution timeline and keep you informed of our progress.

## Scope

This security policy covers the main PyFlashBackup repository and its official releases. If you discover a vulnerability in third-party packages used by PyFlashBackup, please report it directly to the maintainers of those packages.

## Safe Harbor

We appreciate the efforts of security researchers and the broader community in responsibly disclosing security vulnerabilities. PyFlashBackup is committed to providing a safe harbor for those who act in good faith to identify and help us resolve security issues.

## Bug Bounty Program

At this time, PyFlashBackup does not have a formal bug bounty program. However, we are open to discussing appropriate rewards on a case-by-case basis for significant and impactful security vulnerabilities.

Thank you for your contribution to the security of PyFlashBackup and our community.
